This is a simple application for social distancing using Bluetooth low energy(BLE).
It also comprises of a yoga app to relieve mental stress.

Our motivation for this app was the current Covid-19 pandemic going on in the world affecting the health and mental health of people. As y'll know social distancing is beneficial during this time hence this is an app that can alert its user with haptic feedback if any other individual comes within "1.8m" ~ "6ft" of the user. This distance is calculated using BLE sensor of user device and other's emitter. Accurate distance is calculated using the RSSI technology, with standard RSSI being "-69".
